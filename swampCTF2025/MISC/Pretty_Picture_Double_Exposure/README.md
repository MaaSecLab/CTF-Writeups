## Pretty Picture: Double Exposure
### Problem Description
Hidden in the bits below, an image wait's to be shown.

### Solution

The name of the challenge heavily implies that we need to alter the image's exposure. There's some tools online that can do it but they didn't work that well. I went into gimp and increased the black level. After a couple cycles I increased the saturation too to give a easier to read black image. There's a couple characters still missing but the message can be read quite easily.

Have a great day :)
