## BASEic

### Problem Description
The space base is in danger and we lost the key to get in!

### Solution
Two strings are stored inside the program and are encoded in BASE64. One of them is "c3Vue2MwdjNyMW5nX3V" and the other is "cl9CNDUzNX0=" concatenating them and decoding them will result in the flag.

c3Vue2MwdjNyMW5nX3V + yX0I0NTM1fQo= = c3Vue2MwdjNyMW5nX3VyX0I0NTM1fQo=

Have a great day :)
