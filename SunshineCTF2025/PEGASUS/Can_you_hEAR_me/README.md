##  Can you hEAR me?

### Problem Description
A satellite has fallen from orbit, and miraculously, it is still operational. It appears to be running on a RAD-EAR-3 CPU, which is known for its reliability in space applications. The satellite has a handful of program cartridges that it can swap between (like a jukebox), and one of them is labeled "hello". Can you figure out how to run it? We need the satellite's serial number!

### Solution

This is the introductory challenge, so it's quite simple. You just have to run the ROM with ./runpeg CanYouHearMe.peg to get the flag.

Have a great day :)
