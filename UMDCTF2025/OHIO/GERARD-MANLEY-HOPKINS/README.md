### Problem Description
"as kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame; as tumbled over rim in roundy wells stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's bow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name; each mortal thing does one thing and the same: deals out that being indoors each one dwells; selves - goes itself; myself it speaks and spells, crying what i do is me: for that i came. i say more: the just man justices; keeps grace: that keeps all his goings graces; acts in god's eye what in god's eye he is - christ - for christ plays in ten thousand places, lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his to the father through the feature of men's faces.

sorry i just really like poetry. what road are we on?"

### Solution
Zooming in on the trash can on the right shows "Dailey's" which when searched seems to operate in Wellsville, Ohio. Then using the house number on the left and searching it with the city name reveals a Zillow listing for the house. The street adress is "Hillcrest Rd, Wellsville, OH 43968"
