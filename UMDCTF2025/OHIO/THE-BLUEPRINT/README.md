## THE-BLUEPRINT 

### Problem Description
always respect the blueprint (she's never coming back lil bro (i am heartbroken)). anyways, what street are we on?

### Solution
This time we are given yet another image with minimal useable information. Once again the meta-data has been removed from the file.

Since we had no idea about how to approach this challenge, we kept our eye out for any possible hints on the Discord. There were some references to the description of the challenge being a big hint, so we started researching. The main lead we managed to find was the Columbus based musician who goes by the name "Blueprint" but searching for studio and house addresses did not grant us any more information. 

The "she's never coming back" and "I am hearbroken" parts of the description also didn't give us anything specific enough. We then started looking at house listings in the area of Columbus but assumed that this was not the intended solution. 

We then reverse image searched the entire picture. Some pictures of green hills showed up from all around the world. We then specified OHIO alongside it and kept looking. One of the results was an overhead image of a hill, with a road circling it and an offshoot road, which was very similar to the infrastructure shown in the picture. It was linked to an article and the article specified that this was "Alligator Mound" close to the city of Columbus. Looking for the location on google maps and formatting the flag properly completed the challenge.

Have a great day :)
