## UNTITLED GAME
### Problem Description
We made a game.

### Solution

For this challenge we are only given the link to a google drive folder containing the executable. If you download it an execute it you will find yourself in a weird box structure with a few different objects on the floor. None of the object can be interacted with, except for the computer. Using the computer will show us an input field where we will have to input a password. The player keeps saying "To make this work, I need to get out first!", which seems unimporant, but is hinting towards the solution. We could disassemble or decompile the game and then look for the place where the password validation is handled, but tabbing out of the game and into the terminal will give us the flag of the challenge.


Have a great day :)
