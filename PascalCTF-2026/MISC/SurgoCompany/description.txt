SurgoCompany™ has just launched a brand-new online Customer Service platform 🧩. The system is still under development, and you've been asked to test it 😈. Simply enter your email, describe your issue, and optionally upload a file related to your problem 🤨.

The source code of the challenge is saved somewhere on the filesystem... and rumor has it that a file named flag.txt is hiding in that very same folder 😜.

Can you find a way to read it?
